                    <p> Why You Must Dress Professionally for Certain Situations?</p>
                    <p>Maybe it's unjust to judge a book by it's cover, but we all do it.</p>

<p>It's human nature. While the person in jeans may be as competent and as intelligent as the one wearing the formal suit, or more so, we do assess these attributes based on appearance. That's not to say you can forget about preparing for a presentation, put on a nice suit, and you'll wow 'em. All the ingredients—knowledge, preparation, and appearance—are necessary to make a good impression.</p>

<p>When you work at home or in an office where casual attire is the norm, it's difficult to get out of that role and into the role of the professional in front of the audience or in front of a television camera. But, if you want to make a good impression, it's worth the effort. Here's what you need to do.</p>

<p>How to Dress Professionally</p>
<p>Should you go out and purchase a suit for the one or two times a year you'll have to make a presentation? It's probably a good idea. You should buy something classic. After all, if you're only going to wear the suit a couple of times a year, you don't want it to go out of style too quickly.</p>

<p>Women can probably get away with a nice skirt and jacket, while men can wear dress trousers and a jacket. There's also nothing wrong with a pant suit for women. If you're going to be in front of the camera, some special rules apply. Wear neutral colors—dark blue or grey are good, don't wear large or glitzy jewelry, and wear a button down shirt or a jacket so they have somewhere to clip a microphone.</p>

<p>Now about your hair. Your hair should be neat and clean. Try to keep it out of your face. As for makeup (for you women out there), keep it simple. If you're going to be on camera, you should stay away from anything iridescent, frosted, or glittery—matte is best.</p>

<p>As your mother may have told you, sit up straight. When you slouch you look bored. If you look bored, how do you expect your audience to feel? You'll also appear more confident if you are sitting or standing up straight. Look like you're happy to be there. Put a smile on your face. Don't fidget, bite your nails, or play with any jewelry you are wearing. Most importantly, don't forget to breathe.</p>
